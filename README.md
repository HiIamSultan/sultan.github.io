# Hi! I am Sultan!
I am a Ph.D. student at **The Pennsylvania State University**, working in the [Systems and Network Security (SyNSec)](https://synsec-den.github.io/) research lab led by [Dr. Syed Rafiul Hussain](https://syed-rafiul-hussain.github.io/), Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering, Penn State, USA, which focuses on improving the security and privacy of the design and software implementations of emerging networks and complex systems. 

I received my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)**. My major field of undergraduate study was **Communication & Signal Processing** (CSP) and my undergrad thesis domain was interdisciplinary including signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Precisely, I had been working on a project “EEG-based emotion recognition task” under the supervision of Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah (Professor, Dept. of EEE, BUET). I also had done many engineering projects in various domains such as VLSI design, embedded system design, control system design, etc. Before joining Penn State, I was working as a Lecturer at East Delta University, Chattogram, Bangladesh. 

As a Ph.D. student, I want to explore holistic approaches to fundamentally enhance the security investigation of a **Wireless Communication Systems** from the ground up, i.e., starting from analyzing designs, evaluating implementations, monitoring the runtime, and building verified/high-assurance defenses. As part of this process, I would like to combine theory and practice by drawing inspiration from formal methods, program analysis, software testing, signal processing, machine learning and cryptography. I would also love to collaborate with researchers in order to improve my skills in multi-disciplinary domains to contribute to the field of science.
