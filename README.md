# Hi! I am Sultan!
I am a Ph.D. student at **Penn State**, working in the [Systems and Network Security (SyNSec)](https://synsec-den.github.io/) research lab led by [Dr. Syed Rafiul Hussain](https://syed-rafiul-hussain.github.io/), Penn State, USA, which focuses on improving the security and privacy of the design and software implementations of emerging networks and complex systems.

Previously, I worked as a Lecturer at East Delta University, Chattogram, Bangladesh. I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)**. My major field of undergraduate study was Communication & Signal Processing (CSP) and my undergrad thesis domain was interdisciplinary including signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Precisely, I had been working on a project “EEG-based emotion recognition task” under the supervision of Dr. Shaikh Anowarul Fattah (Professor, Dept. of EEE, BUET). I also had done many engineering projects in various domains such as VLSI design, embedded system design, control system design, etc.

I would like to utilize my skills in **Wireless Communication**, **Security & Privacy**, **Machine Learning** and **Signal Processing**. I would love to collaborate with researchers in order to improve my skills in multi-disciplinary domains to contribute to the field of science.
