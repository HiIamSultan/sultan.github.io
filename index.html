                <p>
                    I am a Ph.D. student at <strong>The Pennsylvania State University</strong>, currently working as a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://caeml.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Advanced Electronics Through Machine Learning</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a graduate researcher, I would like to utilize and advance my prior knowledge of signal processing techniques and applied machine learning algorithms. I would also love to collaborate with researchers in order to improve my skills in multi-disciplinary domains to contribute to the field of science.
