                        Objective. Although emotion recognition has been studied for decades, a more accurate classification method that requires less computing is still needed. At present, in many studies, EEG features are extracted from all channels to recognize emotional states, however, there is a lack of an efficient feature domain that improves classification performance and reduces the number of EEG channels. Approach. In this study, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based feature representation of multi-channel EEG data is proposed for automatic emotion recognition. In the proposed feature, the time-frequency domain information is preserved by using CWT coefficients. For a particular EEG channel, each CWT coefficient is mapped into a strength-to-entropy component ratio to obtain a 2D representation. Finally, a 2D feature matrix, namely CEF2D, is created by concatenating these representations from different channels and fed into a deep convolutional neural network architecture. Based on the CWT domain energy-to-entropy ratio, effective channel and CWT scale selection schemes are also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Main results. Compared with previous studies, the results of this study show that valence and arousal classification accuracy has improved in both 3-class and 2-class cases. For the 2-class problem, the average accuracies obtained for valence and arousal dimensions are 98.83% and 98.95%, respectively, and for the 3-class, the accuracies are 98.25% and 98.68%, respectively. Significance. Our findings show that the entropy-based feature of EEG data in the CWT domain is effective for emotion recognition. Utilizing the proposed feature domain, an effective channel selection method can reduce computational complexity.

                        Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) has encompassed a broad research area in the domain of affective computing since the change of emotional states in response to variations in brain activities. In this paper, a novel emotion recognition approach is proposed employing the wavelet decomposition and node reconstruction of EEG signals. Following the wavelet decomposition of the EEG signal into five different levels, a node reconstruction scheme is employed to reconstruct the signal at each level to retain the original signal length. Subsequently, a 2D matrix is formed by combining the reconstructed signal information at all decomposition levels. In view of incorporating the information of multi-channel EEG signal, a 3D frame is formed combining the 2D matrices acquired from all available channels. The frame is applied as an input to a 2D deep neural network where the signal information at different decomposition levels is passed to the depth dimension of the neural network. The proposed method offers substantial performance in the classification process for the valence and arousal domain considering the performance of all subjects. The average accuracies obtained for valence and arousal domains in binary class problems are 93.06% and 91.93% respectively.
