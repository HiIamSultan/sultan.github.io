                </div>
                <p class="authors">
                    This project presents the systematic design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a microwave Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) optimized for stable gain at a center frequency of 1.3 GHz. [cite_start]As the first active stage in a receiver front end, the amplifier was engineered to maximize the overall signal-to-noise ratio by balancing high power gain with unconditional stability and impedance matching. [cite_start]The design leverages a Motorola MRF901 bipolar junction transistor (BJT) biased at 10 V and 10 mA, utilizing an active bias network with a PNP transistor to stabilize the collector current against temperature variations and device parameter shifts.

                <p class="authors">
                    The implementation integrates Keysight Advanced Design System (ADS) for circuit simulation and MATLAB for calculating maximum transducer gain and optimal reflection coefficients. [cite_start]Constructed on an FR-4 substrate using copper tape microstrip traces, the system features custom input and output matching networks synthesized via Smith chart analysis to achieve conjugate matching. [cite_start]To effectively isolate the DC supply from the RF path, the design incorporates optimized radial open stubs tuned to a quarter-wavelength, while the physical layout employed tunable line segments to iteratively correct frequency shifts and align fabrication outcomes with simulation models.

                    Validating the design through Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) measurements, the final amplifier achieved a peak forward gain of approximately 10.51 dB and unconditional stability across the operating band, closely aligning with theoretical predictions for lossy microstrip lines. [cite_start]The project successfully demonstrated a 1-dB bandwidth of roughly 130 MHz and highlighted the critical role of iterative physical tuning in overcoming dielectric losses and fabrication tolerances inherent in standard FR-4 substrates.

                <p class="authors">
                    This project introduces an innovative approach to goal detection in soccer by leveraging radar technology to identify when a soccer ball crosses the goal line. It eliminates the dependency on expensive VAR systems by classifying radar reflections to accurately distinguish the soccer ball from players and equipment. Utilizing radar cross-section (RCS) characteristics, the system tracks the soccer ball in real-time near the critical goal line area.

                    The implementation uses MATLAB and Python for signal processing, Remcom WaveFarer simulations for generating datasets, and a ResNet50-based classifier for detecting goal scenarios. With careful radar placement and an optimized machine learning model, the system can achieve high accuracy and highlights the potential for cost-effective sports analytics solutions.

                    <h2>Signal Overshadowing Attack by Manipulating LTE Broadcast Signals Using SDR Platforms</a></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="authors">
                    This project explores the vulnerabilities in LTE broadcast messages and demonstrates a signal overshadowing attack, which exploits the absence of integrity protection in LTE broadcast signals. Using this approach, malicious signals are injected over the air without deploying a fake base station (FBS), leveraging the capture effect to ensure the stronger signal is decoded by victim devices. This attack modifies critical LTE broadcast messages, such as Master Information Block (MIB) and System Information Blocks (SIBs), enabling scenarios like denial-of-service and network downgrading.

                <p class="authors">
                    Implemented on the srsRAN 4G platform, the attack utilizes synchronized USRPs for precise timing and frequency alignment, ensuring high stealth and success rates. The project highlights the need for stronger defenses, such as digital signatures for LTE broadcast messages, to counter such stealthy attacks. Ethical considerations and compliance with local regulations are crucial while experimenting with this project to avoid interference with operational networks.

                    <h2>Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal in Time-Frequency Domain with Reduced Channels Using Deep Neural Architecture</a></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="authors">In this project, an automatic emotion recognition scheme is adopted utilizing a multi-channel EEG signal that can discriminate between different classes of emotions and select some significant channels that are mostly responsible for the elicitation of emotions. The main theme of the proposed method is to classify emotions with deep neural architectures with the raw EEG data or the extracted features from it. The baseline of the EEG signal is excluded from the recorded data in the pre-processing stage to obtain the raw EEG signal relevant to emotion elicitation in response to the audio-visual stimuli. The baseline excluded raw EEG signal is divided into multiple segments to increase the number of EEG trials and combining all the channel information of an EEG trial, the obtained 2D matrix is applied to the proposed deep neural architecture. The proposed network with its channel attention mechanism offers satisfactory classification performance. As the spectral information provides salient information regarding different emotional states, the EEG trial signals are decomposed into several sub-bands and 3D frames are formed combining the temporal and spectral information of the available channels. The frame contains significant information that eventually provides superior classification performance. In addition, EEG signals are also analyzed in the time-frequency domain, where the multi-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients or the extracted feature from the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) domain is considered. For a given channel of EEG data, each CWT coefficient from different scales is mapped into a corresponding strength-to-entropy component ratio (SECR) plane to obtain a 2D feature matrix, namely CEF2D. In order to reduce the computational complexity, effective channels and CWT scale selection schemes are proposed based on the energy-to-entropy ratio in the CWT domain. Extensive experimentation is carried out on a publicly available emotion (DEAP) dataset and very satisfactory classification performance is obtained for valence and arousal types of emotions both in 3-class and 2-class scenarios.</p>
