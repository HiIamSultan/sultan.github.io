                    <h2>Automatic Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal in Time-Frequency Domain with Reduced Channels Using Deep Neural Architecture</a></h2>
                </div>
                <p class="authors">Emotion recognition using the electroencephalogram (EEG) has attained great attention in the arena of human-computer interaction (HCI) due to the existence of variations in neural activities at different types of emotions. In this thesis, an automatic emotion recognition scheme is adopted utilizing a multi-channel EEG signal that can discriminate between different classes of emotions and select some significant channels that are mostly responsible for the elicitation of emotions. The main theme of the proposed method is to classify emotions with deep neural architectures with the raw EEG data or the extracted features from it. The baseline of the EEG signal is excluded from the recorded data in the pre-processing stage to obtain the raw EEG signal relevant to emotion elicitation in response to the audio-visual stimuli. The baseline excluded raw EEG signal is divided into multiple segments to increase the number of EEG trials and combining all the channel information of an EEG trial, the obtained 2D matrix is applied to the proposed deep neural architecture. The proposed network with its channel attention mechanism offers satisfactory classification performance. As the spectral information provides salient information regarding different emotional states, the EEG trial signals are decomposed into several subbands and 3D frames are formed combining the temporal and spectral information of the available channels. The frame contains significant information that eventually provides superior classification performance. In addition, EEG signals are also analyzed in the timefrequency domain, where the multi-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients or the extracted feature from the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) domain is considered. For a given channel of EEG data, each CWT coefficient from different scales is mapped into a corresponding strength-to-entropy component ratio (SECR) plane to obtain a 2D feature matrix, namely CEF2D. In order to reduce the computational complexity, effective channels and CWT scale selection schemes are proposed based on the energy-to-entropy ratio in the CWT domain. Extensive experimentation is carried out on a publicly available emotion (DEAP) dataset and very satisfactory classification performance is obtained for valence and arousal types of emotions both in 3-class and 2-class scenarios.</p>
